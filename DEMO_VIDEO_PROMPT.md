**Target Audience:** College students looking for notes, study tools, and a community.
**Tone:** Energetic, Modern, Encouraging, and Clear.
**Duration:** Approx 2-3 minutes.

**Video Flow to Cover:**
1. **Hero Section (Landing Page)**: Start with the landing page. Hook the viewer with the value proposition ("The ultimate academic weapon").
2. **Login/Signup Flow**: Briefly show the smooth login process (using email or Google).
3. **Onboarding/Dashboard**: Land on the "Smart Dashboard". Highlight the 'Daily Missions', 'Stats' (Coins/XP), and 'Recent Activity'. 
4. **Resource Hub**: Navigate to the library. Show filtering by Course/Year. Preview a PDF note. Show the "Like" feature.
5. **Study Tools**:
    - **Flashcards**: Show selecting a deck and flipping a card for active recall.
    - **Study Rooms**: Join a virtual room, show the Pomodoro timer and chat.
6. **Community/Forum**: briefly show asking a question or upvoting an answer.
7. **Conclusion**: Wrap up on the dashboard or a "Join Now" screen. Call to action.

**Requirements:**
- Write the script in a 2-column format: **Visuals** (what is happening on screen) and **Audio/Voiceover** (what the narrator says).
- Keep the voiceover time-synced with typical navigation speed.
- Emphasize the "Gamification" elements (earning XP for studying) throughout the script.
